## Sample chopping
web app developed with vanilla javascript and the Web Audio API.  
  
My first attempt into building a web app, before diving into frameworks. Still rough around the edges, but hey, it works!  
  
* Upload multiple local files or record directly in the browser;
* Chop the files into N slices and play them with the keyboard individually;
* Tempo sync the audio loops or set the master Tempo from a loop; 
* Launch clips on beat with the snap feature (much like Live);
* Export a trimmed loop into a wav file;
* SVG animated dot for the metronome!
